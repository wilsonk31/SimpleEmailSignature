# SimpleEmailSignature
Simple Email Signature made in HTML

Steps: 
1. Open the SimpleEmailSignature.html (Whatever Text Editor you like)
2. Make changes to the HTML code
3. Open the file in a browser
4. Copy the signature and paste it to your Email's "signature" section in the settings

Side Note:

Images I used where found on the google image search, right click on an image and use "Copy Image Address" to use a diffrent image and paste it directly in the src in the image tag. 
must have an extention like ".png"
